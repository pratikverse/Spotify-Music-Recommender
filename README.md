# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Music Recommender

## Overview

This project is a music recommendation system that suggests tracks similar from different genres to a user-selected song. It leverages machine learning techniques, specifically an autoencoder for feature extraction and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for finding similar tracks. The system is implemented as a Streamlit web application, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

* **Track Recommendations:** Users can select a track from the Spotify dataset acquired from Huggingface, and the system recommends nine similar tracks.
* **Genre Visualization:** A 3D visualization of tracks in the dataset, colored by genre, provides insights into the relationships between different music genres.
* **Web Application:** The Streamlit application provides an intuitive interface for exploring recommendations.

## Technical Details

1.  **Data Preprocessing**
    * The Spotify tracks dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
    * Numeric features relevant to track similarity (e.g., danceability, energy, loudness) are selected.
    * Data is scaled using StandardScaler.
    * Categorical genre data is encoded.

2.  **Feature Extraction**
    * An autoencoder neural network is trained to reduce the dimensionality of the track features into a lower-dimensional "latent space."  This helps the model to capture the essential characteristics of each song.
    * The encoder part of the autoencoder is used to generate the latent representations for all tracks.

3.  **Similarity Calculation**
    * A KNN model is trained on the latent representations of the tracks.  The cosine distance metric is used to measure similarity between tracks in the latent space.

4.  **Recommendation Generation**
    * When a user selects a track, the KNN model finds the k-nearest neighbors (most similar tracks) in the latent space.
    * The system returns the top 9 most similar tracks as recommendations.

5.  **Web Application**
    * Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application.
    * Users can select a song, view its audio preview, and see recommendations.
    * The 3D genre visualization is displayed using Plotly.
